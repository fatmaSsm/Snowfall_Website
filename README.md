This project is a small New Year themed website created to celebrate the beginning of 2026.
There’s a cozy New Year background, some gentle falling snow, and a layout that works nicely on both desktop and mobile screens.

Wishing you a year full of good vibes, smooth code, and fewer bugs.  
Happy New Year! 🎄✨
